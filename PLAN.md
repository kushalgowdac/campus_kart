# CampusKart End-to-End Completion Plan

1. Review requirements and ER artifacts (PDF/ODT) to extract functional, data, and API needs.
2. Compare requirements with current database schema and seed data; reconcile differences and finalize schema.
3. Define backend API surface (routes, controllers, validation, error handling) aligned to requirements.
4. Implement database access layer (queries, transactions) using MySQL pool.
5. Implement backend routes/controllers for core flows: auth/users, products, wishlist, orders/transactions, media/specs/locations.
6. Add middleware (CORS, JSON, request validation, error handling, logging).
7. Populate seed data and provide SQL scripts for setup.
8. Create frontend app (structure, pages, API integration, state management) per requirements.
9. Add basic UI/UX and client-side validation.
10. Add documentation: setup, environment variables, API docs, and run steps.
11. Test critical flows end-to-end and fix issues.
